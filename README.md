# 🕸️ GhostRouter
### **Telemetry-Driven LLM Meta-Router with Real-Time Entropy Slope Tracking, Token Replay Engine & Hybrid Routing**
*A new class of AI infrastructure where routing decisions are made by token-level signals — not heuristics.*

---

## 🌑 What is GhostRouter?

GhostRouter is an experimental **meta-router** that decides *which model should think next* — locally, in the cloud, or via a specialized route.

It uses **live token metrics** to predict hallucinations *before they happen*, and switches models mid-thought while preserving reasoning continuity through the **Token Replay Engine**.

GhostRouter does not guess.  
GhostRouter observes → routes → learns → adapts.

## 🟣 Why GhostRouter is a New Paradigm

Most routers use static rules or task-based chaining.

GhostRouter introduces **three innovations** not found in any existing framework:

---

### 🟣 1. Real-Time Entropy Slope Routing (unique)

GhostRouter reads:
- token entropy  
- entropy slope (Δentropy/t)  
- draft acceptance rate  
- local confidence  
- latency & GPU load  

This allows it to:
**predict hallucination before it manifests**  
→ and switch to a better model **mid-generation**.

No other open-source router does this.

---

### 🟣 2. Token Replay Engine (new concept)

When switching from Local → Cloud or Cloud → Local:

- GhostRouter replays the last N tokens  
- rebuilds KV-cache  
- preserves thought chain  
- avoids context resets  

This creates **true reasoning continuity**,  
not just pipelining or chaining.

---

### 🟣 3. Telemetry-First Architecture

Routing is driven by data, not heuristics.

GhostRouter logs:
- entropy  
- entropy slope  
- draft acceptance  
- route_switch events  
- model latency  
- GPU/RAM telemetry  
- confidence signals  

This powers the **Ghost Telemetry Dashboard** (W&B/Grafana).
