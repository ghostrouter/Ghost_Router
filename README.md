GhostRouter — A telemetry-driven LLM meta-router with real-time entropy slope tracking, Token Replay Engine, and self-optimizing hybrid routing.
A new paradigm where routing decisions are made by token-level signals — enabling dynamic local↔cloud switching, thought-continuity, and hallucination-prevention before it happens.
